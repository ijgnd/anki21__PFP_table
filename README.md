anki add-on

I made this because the add-on [Power Format Pack](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/162313389) won't be ported to 2.1 and the [Mini Format Pack](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/295889520) doesn't seem to include a function for tables.

I quickly extracted the table function from PFP into a standalone version for 2.1. Hackish but works so far. 

Use it at your own risk
