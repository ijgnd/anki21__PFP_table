<b># Use</b>
The shortcut (default is "Ctrl+0") to insert a table and some styling defaults can be configured using the new configuration dialogue of 2.1: Tools&gt;Add-ons, select the add-on and click on "Config".

You can insert a table in two ways:
1. If you do not select any text, upon clicking the "Create a table button" (or pressing the shortcut) you will be presented with a dialog window asking you to specify some table properties (like number of rows, number of columns, alignment, styling). The dialog to insert tables looks like this:

2. If you have text selected you can usually convert a table (in a markdown-like format) into a full html table. 
<code>header1 | header2</code>
<code>-|-</code>
<code>elem1 | elem2</code>
These will create a list with two columns and two rows. The <code>-|-</code> part is optional, but can be used to align the column to the left (<code>:-</code>), right (<code>-:</code>) or to the center (<code>:-:</code>). You can skip this line completely, but do make sure you add a pipe character | between elements to designate a border. 
Limitations:
- This method is intended for one time use only. The original md-table is not saved so it can't be undone later. If you care about undoing use one of the markdown add-ons. 
- The code in my add-on for transforming markdown tables is simple so that it doesn't convert all valid markdown tables. So it will fail sometimes. A fix for this is already on my todo list but it will take some time until this add-on is updated.

<b>Use the add-on at your own risk.</b>

<b># Update notice</b>
- For styling the table versions after the update from 2020-07-24 now use "table_style_css_V<i>4</i>". Prior versions of this add-on used the config keys "table_style_css", "table_style_css_V2" or "table_style_css_V3". If you had modified one of these you'll have to copy over your changes to "table_style_css_V<i>4</i>". "V4" was introduced to better deal with Anki's night mode.
- This add-on does not delete your old customized config. The latest version just ignores the config keys "table_style_css", "table_style_css_V2" or "table_style_css_V3".

<b># Credits</b>
This add-on and parts of this description are a partial fork of the great add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/162313389" rel="nofollow">Power Format Pack</a> (Copyright 2014-2017 Stefan van den Akker) because it won't be ported to 2.1 (as of 2018-11). I extracted the table function into a standalone version for 2.1 and in the latest version made some additions so that you can better customize the table inserted. All the good stuff in this add-on is from Stefan van den Akker.

<b># limitations, known bugs</b>
Short selections of text, mostly if the last line doesn't contain real content but just empty fields (like '|| |') usually gives unexpected/wrong results.

<b># bugs, errors, feedback</b>
Please do not use reviews for bug reports or support requests. I don't get notified of your reviews, and properly troubleshooting an issue through them is nearly impossible (formatting is limited and I can't reply multiple times).
