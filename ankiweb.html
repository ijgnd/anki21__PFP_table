<b># About Anki 2.0</b>
If you want to add tables in the old Anki 2.0 use the function from the add-on  <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/162313389" rel="nofollow">Power Format Pack</a>. This add-on is still listed as available for Anki 2.0 because you can't unpublish add-ons just for 2.0 and the <a href="https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/ankiweb/3982-unpublish-delete-add-on-version-for-20" rel="nofollow">officially recommended way</a> is to just post a message that Anki 2.0 is no longer supported. I removed the version for 2.0 because it set the alignment without using the style attribute. You can still download it <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki__editor_add_table/archive/72e8fca3a64491cf5d8bcad566833e91e835ccd4.zip" rel="nofollow">from github as a zip file</a>. To use it you would have to copy the contents of the src folder in your addon folder.

<b># Update notice</b>
If you installed before 2019-10-08 and updated and changed the config setting "table_style_css" you must adjust these to the new "table_style_css_V2"

<b># Use</b>
The shortcut to insert a table and some styling defaults can be configured using the new configuration dialogue of 2.1: Tools&gt;Add-ons, select the add-on and click on "Config".

You can insert a table in two ways:
1. If you do not select any text, upon clicking the "Create a table button" (or pressing the shortcut) you will be presented with a dialog window asking you to specify some table properties (like number of rows, number of columns, alignment, styling). The dialog to insert tables looks like this: 
 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ijgnd/anki21__PFP_table/master/screenshots/options.png"> 
2. If you have text selected you can convert a table (in markdown format) into a full html table. 
<code>header1 | header2</code>
<code>-|-</code>
<code>elem1 | elem2</code>
These will create a list with two columns and two rows. The <code>-|-</code> part is optional, but can be used to align the column to the left (<code>:-</code>), right (<code>-:</code>) or to the center (<code>:-:</code>). You can skip this line completely, but do make sure you add a pipe character | between elements to designate a border. 

Use the add-on at your own risk.

<b># Credits</b>
This add-on and parts of this description are a partial fork of the great add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/162313389" rel="nofollow">Power Format Pack</a> (Copyright 2014-2017 Stefan van den Akker) because it won't be ported to 2.1 (as of 2018-11). I extracted the table function into a standalone version for 2.1 and in the latest version made some small additions so that you can better customize the table inserted. All the good stuff in this add-on is from Stefan van den Akker.

The style "less ugly" is incorporated from an anonymously uploaded forked version <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1467671504" rel="nofollow">add tables with less ugly tables</a>.
